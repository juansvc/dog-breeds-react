# Dogs

@juan-vivanco

## Overview

A React Frontend task for Shopventory. of a web application to show dog breeds images.

## Technologies Used

- [React JS / React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) API calls
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) CSS Framework
- [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api) for dogs data/media

## Process

I started off using `create-react-app` to build out the framework, then implementing layout and components. In order not to invent warm water and in honor of the time I decided to use a CSS Framework since I am not making styles based on a mockup/pixel perfect (Figma, Sketch). As for design as it was free to choose without requirements and I really like dark mode in web apps I have done so, as points that remain to be done could be done light mode and navigation with react router, infinity scroll for more images, lazy load, etc.

## Installation

- `git clone` this repo and `cd` into the `dogs` folder
- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn start` to run frontend app
